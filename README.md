## Steps to go through:

### Before we start you should know

1. I have Installed Jest - just like Chai or Mocha which you've already seen!

2. I've written the first failing test - we're going to write the code to pass this test!

3. I have exported the randomizer!

4. You will only be working in the index.js file!

### TODO

1. Run 'npm test' -> Result should be two failing test

2. Add return of an empty array to function

3. Run 'npm test' -> Result should be two failing tests

4. Write object assertion typeof result at index 0

5. Run 'npm test' -> Result should be two failing tests

6. Add students array as parameter

7. Create results array

8. Build loop to loop through the array

9. Pull elements from the array and put two at a time into an object

10. Push that object into the result array

11. Return the result array

12. Run 'npm test' -> Result should be passing test 1

13. Refactor code to handle odd number of people

14. Run 'npm test' -> Result should be two passing tests
