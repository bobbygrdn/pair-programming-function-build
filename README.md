## Steps to go through:

### Before we start you should know

1. I have Installed Jest - just like Chai or Mocha which you've already seen!

2. I've written the first failing test - we're going to write the code to pass this test!

3. I have exported the randomizer!

### TODO

1. Run 'npm test' -> Result should be two failing test

2. Look at the error for the test -> The error says randomizer.randomize is not a function

3. Add function

4. Run 'npm test' -> Result should be two failing tests

5. Add return of an empty array to function

6. Run 'npm test' -> Result should be two failing tests

7. Write object assertion typeof result at index 0

8. Run 'npm test' -> Result should be two failing tests

9. Add students array as parameter

10. Create results array

11. Build loop to loop through the array

12. Pull elements from the array and put two at a time into an object

13. Push that object into the result array

14. Return the result array

15. Run 'npm test' -> Result should be passing test 1

16. Refactor code to include one object with 3 people

17. Run 'npm test' -> Result should be two passing tests
