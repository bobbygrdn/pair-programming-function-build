## Steps to go through:

### Before we start you should know

1. I have Installed Jest - just like Chai or Mocha which you've already seen!

2. I've written the first failing test - we're going to write the code to pass this test!

3. I have exported the randomizer!

4. You will only be working in the index.js file!

### TODO

1. Run 'npm install' -> This will install all necessary modules

2. Run 'npm test' -> Result should be two failing tests

3. Add results array

4. Run 'npm test' -> Result should be two failing tests

5. Build loop to loop through the students array

6. Pull elements from the array and put two at a time into an object

7. Push that object into the result array

8. Return the result array

9. Run 'npm test' -> Result should be passing test 1

10. Refactor code to handle odd number of people

11. Run 'npm test' -> Result should be two passing tests
